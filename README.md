# A demo application for Go Webserver
This is a go webserver that I wrote to learn the Go language

## Quickstart
If you just want to see the project you can run the `./gowiki` file

If you want to modify the files:

Run `go get ./...` to install all the dependencies needed for the project

Afterwards you can use `go build` to build the project and then run it again with `./gowiki`
